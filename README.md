# Customer Churn Analysis #
Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company's customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it.

# Introduction #
## What is Customer Churning:
  * Customer Churning refers to the process by which customers discontinue their relationship with a business, stop using their products or services, and move on to a      competitor or alternative solution. In other words, it is the rate at which customers leave a business over a specific period. Customer churn is a critical metric for    any business, as it has a direct impact on the company's revenue and growth prospects. A high customer churn rate can indicate that a business is not meeting the       needs of its customers, leading to a loss of business, while a low churn rate can indicate that customers are satisfied with the company's products or services. Thus,     minimizing customer churn is a priority for businesses looking to achieve sustainable growth.

## What are the different Churn Scenarios ?
  * Tariff Plan Churn
  * Service Churn
  * Product Churn
  * Usage Churn

  #### Conditional Churner
  #### Lifestyle Migrator
   * Uncontrollable change in needs/usage
   * Bheaviour
   * Involuntary Churn
  #### Unsatisfied Churner
   * Unsatisfied Customer

## In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.

### 🟢 For EDA, please refer to : Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb  
### 🟢 For Model Building, please refer to: Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb  
### 🟢 For Model Deployment, please refer to main.py  
### 🟢 Creating the flask API

```
app = Flask("__name__")
```

The loadPage method calls our home.html.
```
@app.route("/")
def loadPage():
	return render_template('home.html', query="")
```

The predict method is our POST method, which is basically called when we pass all the inputs from our front end and click SUBMIT.
```
@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def predict():
```
  
The run() method of Flask class runs the application on the local development server.
```
app.run()
```


Yay, our model is ready, let’s test our bot.
The above given Python script is executed from Python shell.

Go to Anaconda Prompt, and run the below query.
```
python app.py
```


Below message in Python shell is seen, which indicates that our App is now hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000
```
 Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```


HERE'S HOW OUR FRONTEND LOOKS LIKE:
