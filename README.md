# Customer Churn Analysis #
Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company's customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it.

# Introduction #
* What is Customer Churning:
  * Customer Churning refers to the process by which customers discontinue their relationship with a business, stop using their products or services, and move on to a      competitor or alternative solution. In other words, it is the rate at which customers leave a business over a specific period. Customer churn is a critical metric for    any business, as it has a direct impact on the company's revenue and growth prospects. A high customer churn rate can indicate that a business is not meeting the       needs of its customers, leading to a loss of business, while a low churn rate can indicate that customers are satisfied with the company's products or services. Thus,     minimizing customer churn is a priority for businesses looking to achieve sustainable growth.
